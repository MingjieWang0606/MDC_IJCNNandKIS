# Improving Stock Trend Prediction with Multi-granularity Denoising Contrastive Learning
Research code that accompanies the paper [Improving Stock Trend Prediction with Multi-granularity Denoising Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/).

The basic version of the article has been accepted by IJCNN2023, and the extended version for the journal has been accepted to Knowledge and Information Systems.

In memory.py, I provided the code for obtaining positive and negative samples based on the memory module.
At the same time, in tool.py, I attached the all loss functions used.
